# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. Some of it is great, some of it is stupid, most of it is stolen from [@clauswit](https://github.com/clauswitt) and [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens). Enter at own risk.

## Install
- Run `./Install` to install .files ([`tmux`](https://tmux.github.io/), [`vim`](http://www.vim.org/), `zsh`, etc.)
