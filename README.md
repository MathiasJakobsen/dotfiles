# Orion .files
My personal .files - more than heavily inspired by [@clauswitt](https://github.com/clauswitt) and [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynes).

## Run
1. `./brew.sh` - to install homebrew, packages and application 
2. `./install-rvm.sh`- to install RVM and some rubies
3. `./install.sh` - to install .files
4. `./osx` - to setup OS X settings

# Todo
- Disable MySQL strict mode in `/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.xx/my.cnf`
